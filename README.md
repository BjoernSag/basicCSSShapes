I made own CSS files for rectangle, triangle and circle not because I needed them, but to make it more clear what parts were animation and what parts were setup with spacing, grids and some of the animations needed to be changed a little for it to make sense on different viewports. Look to square.js if you want to see one example of everything being done in one file with Styled components.


To see an example of these animations on a real page, please take a look at https://bjoernsagstad.herokuapp.com/fremgangsmaate-og-pris
