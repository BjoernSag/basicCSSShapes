This is a few examples of CSS shape animation that I use on my website.

PS: I made CSS files for rectangle, triangle and circle not because I needed them, but to make it more clear what parts were animation and what parts were setup with spacing, grids and viewports. Look to square.js if you want to see one example of everything being done in one file with Styled components.


To see an example of these animations on a real page, please take a look at https://bjoernsagstad.herokuapp.com/fremgangsmaate-og-pris
